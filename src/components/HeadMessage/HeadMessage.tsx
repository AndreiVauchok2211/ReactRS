        Hi, left comments in two sections of code - couldnt find the problem in
        the types, mapping an empty array. I didnt have time to make tests, I
        would be grateful if you check my work last and dont remove points for
        commits. No routing, functionality of pagination and card detailing by
        click is not implemented
      </h1>
    </div>
  );
};
