        Hi!! I am skipping the assignment React. Next.JS/SSR/SSG - as I am
        trying to fill the gaps in my knowledge and implement all the
        functionality from the previous tasks - what I was advised to do and
        what seems more necessary for the next and final task. You may not check
        my assignment. Thanks for earlier and good luck on the course!
